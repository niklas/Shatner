h1. Introduction

An Erector based collection of resource-oriented widgets


h1. Examples

Let's say you have a model called Document and you supply a +document.shat+
file like the following:

   group "General" do
      string :title
      belongs_to :owner, :readonly => true
   end
   group "Content" do
      textile :body
   end
   group "Images" do
      has_many :images
   end


h1. Features

Shatner will provide you with:
* forms to create and update any document
* views to show the document in the same way it was edited
  (think of a Rails FormBuilder on steroids, coupled to a "ShowBuilder", 
   both using the same template file)
* the possibility of viewing/editing only one of the above groups to the user, 
   be it as tabs, accordion or totally separate requests through urls like /documents/1/edit/images
